> After so many hours of googling and configuring, i finally installed this blog on my system.
> So, I should clear few things first.

1. These are just my *End of the day* thoughts.
2. I don't mean to disrespect anyone's identity be it based on race, religion, gender, caste etc. etc

## Why

So i was thinking to get a actual diary, to write any thing, like some incident, random thoughts, awesome quote, or poem. But then again, its likely some day someone will read it, and this writing is not for such purpose its just for my own processing and figuring out. But then again you should be asking then why are you writing to me by using "you", actually i don't mind if someone reads it and it also becomes easy to write to someone. One reason is also to make it a habit of
good writing.

## What topics am i going to cover

Everything that i think, and not whats out there as general knowledge, be it Today's actions and their results like taking a stand for something and what was the result or approaching a woman that i think is beautifull, religion ( ofcourse i shall never support or be against one ), technology like what today's some invention may mean for future days.

It's not going to include any specific about anyone or anything as this blog is about the contents and not the doer or generator of the contents ;).
